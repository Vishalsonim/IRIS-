# IRIS-
The iris dataset contains three classes of flowers, Versicolor, Setosa, Virginica, and each class contains 4 features, ‘Sepal length’, ‘Sepal width’, ‘Petal length’, ‘Petal width’. The aim of the iris flower classification is to predict flowers based on their specific features.
First, we’ve imported some necessary packages for the project.

Numpy will be used for any computational operations.
We’ll use Matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
Pandas help to load data from various sources like local storage, database, excel file, CSV file, etc.
Next, we load the data using pd.read_csv() and set the column name as per the iris data information.
Pd.read_csv reads CSV files. CSV stands for comma separated value.
Analyze and visualize the dataset:
train the model
modle predict the highest accuracy based on the data.
